# 5. Upgrade to cert-manager v1.5 (IBM badged version)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: this is not a requirement for MAS itself, but for CP4D v4

# 5.1 Uninstall jetstack cert-manager from cert-manager namespace
# 5.2 Install IBM cert-manager to the ibm-common-services namespace
# 5.3 Copy secrets from cert-manager namespace to ibm-common-services
# 5.4 Copy ClusterIssuers, Issuers and Certificates from cert-manager namespace to ibm-common-services
# 5.5 Verify all ClusterIssuers, Issuers, and Certificates are in a healthy state
# 5.6 Update the existing MAS 8.6 install to configure the suite to use cert-manager in the new namespace
# 5.7 Verify the existing MAS 8.6 install is happy with the cert-manager switch over

# Note 1: MAS should not experience any outage during this upgrade, but certificates etc will
#         not be able to be updated during this process
# Note 2: This is a cluster wide change, anything else in the using using cert-manager will
#         need to be updated to refer to the new namespace


# 6. Check version of CP4D (and upgrade to v4)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sorry, I have no idea how the CP4D upgrade should work, or what kinds of
# steps are required to migrate data from v3.5 to v4.0 and ensure everything
# continues to just work.
#
# Different namespaces are being used (cpd-meta-ops & cpd-services) so maybe we
# have both installed at the same time to migrate data?
#
# - How do we migrate a Db2 instance from CP4D v3.5 to v4?
# - How do we migrate <whatever> is being used in Watson Studio so that it
#   carries over into the v4 installation?


# 7. Upgrade the Subscription for ibm-mas to 8.7.x channel
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 8. (optionally) Upgrade the application operators
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You don't need to upgrade the applications, you can leave them at the n-1
# supported versions from your prevoius MAS 8.6 installation if you wish.


# 9. (optionally) Upgrade OCP to v4.8
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAS 8.7 is fully supported on both OCP 4.6 and 4.8, however at some point
# before you eventually upgrade to MAS 8.8 you will need to upgrade OCP to v4.8
#
# https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update#master

# 10. (optionally) Upgrade SBO to v1.0 - only if you upgraded to OCP v4.8
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAS 8.7 fully supports both the preview and stable channels of the Red Hat
# service binding operator, however at some point before you eventually upgrade
# to MAS 8.8 you will need to upgrade to the stable channel.  The stable
# channel is not available in OCP 4.6
