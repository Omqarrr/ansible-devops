# Sorry, I have no idea how the CP4D upgrade should work, or what kinds of
# steps are required to migrate data from v3.5 to v4.0 and ensure everything
# continues to just work.
#
# Different namespaces are being used (cpd-meta-ops & cpd-services) so maybe we
# have both installed at the same time to migrate data?
#
# - How do we migrate a Db2 instance from CP4D v3.5 to v4?
# - How do we migrate <whatever> is being used in Watson Studio so that it
#   carries over into the v4 installation?
# - No upgrade for Discovery (when we tried to upgrade our development env
#   from CP4D 3.5 + WD 2.2.1 ---> CP4D 4.0 + WD 4.0 we met a lot of issues.
#   The process is quite complex and we met a lot of issues)
